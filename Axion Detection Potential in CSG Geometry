# Axion Detection Potential in CSG Geometry

## Background

Recent theoretical work by Zupan et al. (2025, *Journal of High Energy Physics*) demonstrates that deuterium-tritium fusion reactors can produce axions—hypothetical particles that may constitute dark matter—through two mechanisms:

1. **Neutron-nucleus reactions** when fusion neutrons interact with lithium and other nuclei in blanket materials
1. **Bremsstrahlung radiation** as neutrons decelerate in reactor walls

This work solved a problem previously featured as unsolved on the TV show *The Big Bang Theory* (Season 5).

## Geometric Advantages of CSG

### Standard Tokamak Limitations

- Toroidal plasma geometry
- Chaotic, random neutron-wall interactions
- Scattered bremsstrahlung with no coherent structure
- Difficult to distinguish axion signals from background noise

### CSG Truncated Icosahedron Benefits

The CSG uses **32 distributed fusion sources** (12 pentagons + 20 hexagons) arranged in truncated icosahedral geometry. This creates:

- **Symmetric neutron flux** from geometrically defined points
- **Predictable interaction zones** in the breeding blanket
- **Directional information** for particle detection
- **Time-correlation capability** through pulsed sector operation

## Detector Integration Strategy

### Positioning

- **60 vertices** of truncated icosahedron available for detector modules
- Symmetry enables directional reconstruction of axion production
- Clean angular separation between source regions

### Signal Processing

The geometric structure enables:

- **Spatial correlation** analysis matching icosahedral symmetry
- **Temporal gating** synchronized with specific fusion source activation
- **Directional cuts** to reduce isotropic background
- **Coincidence detection** across symmetrically positioned sensors

### Blanket Tuning

Different faces can use different materials to emphasize specific axion production channels:

- Pure Li-6 on selected faces for neutron-lithium reactions
- Li-Pb eutectic on others for bremsstrahlung enhancement
- Standard breeding blanket as baseline reference

This creates **spectral diversity** in axion production for better characterization.

## Practical Implementation

### Minimal Design Changes

1. **Sensor ports** at vertex positions (already available in modular design)
1. **Microwave cavity resonators** for axion-to-photon conversion
1. **Time-stamping electronics** (nanosecond precision)
1. **Data pipeline** to computational system for correlation analysis

### Research Value

- **Controllable axion source** vs. passive solar/astrophysical observations
- **Multi-channel production** (nuclear + bremsstrahlung)
- **Directional information** not available in isotropic detectors
- **High neutron flux** in compact geometry

## Coherence Considerations

While individual axion production events are likely incoherent, the geometric arrangement provides:

**Constructive enhancement through spatial organization:**

- Axion production rate scales linearly with random sources: `A_total ≈ N × A_single`
- With geometric correlation factors: `A_total ≈ N × [1 + (N-1) × C_geom] × A_single`
- For N=32 sources, even modest geometric coherence (C_geom ≈ 0.1-0.3) yields significant enhancement

**More importantly—cleaner detection:**
The primary advantage isn’t necessarily *more* axions, but **better signal extraction** through:

- Known source positions enable background subtraction
- Symmetry-breaking events stand out against geometric pattern
- Time-correlation removes random coincidences
- Directional reconstruction identifies production mechanisms

## Relation to Ocean Restoration Mission

This reactor was designed to power ocean cleanup vessels—axion detection is a **secondary discovery**, not the primary purpose.

However, dual-use capability provides:

- Academic research partnerships for validation
- Additional funding streams (DOE High Energy Physics, NSF)
- Broader scientific impact beyond energy production
- International collaboration opportunities

**The mission remains planetary healing.** Dark matter research is a bonus that may accelerate technology validation and deployment.

## Open Questions for Researchers

1. What is the expected axion production rate per fusion source in CSG geometry?
1. Can time-gating with pulsed operation achieve measurable signal-to-noise improvement?
1. Which blanket materials optimize which axion production channels?
1. What detector technologies are best suited for vertex positioning constraints?
1. Can machine learning extract geometric signatures from multi-channel data?
