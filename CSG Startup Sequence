# CSG Biomimetic Startup Sequence

## Two-Page Technical Summary for GitHub Integration

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** December 19, 2025  
**Integration:** Unified with CSG Open Source Publication and 122-coil RF system

-----

## Overview

The Cognitive Supernova Generator (CSG) employs a **biomimetic startup sequence** inspired by adenovirus self-assembly to solve the critical challenge that kills most fusion concepts: **off-nominal operation**. While most fusion designs focus on steady-state performance, the CSG addresses startup, restart, and failure scenarios from the beginning through nature-inspired sequential activation.

## Core Innovation: Sequential Icosahedral Activation

### Adenovirus Assembly Model

1. **Pentamers form at vertices first** → Establishes geometric skeleton
1. **Hexamers fill faces** → Completes structure
1. **Fiber proteins activate** → Provides function

### CSG Reactor Mapping

1. **12 vertex superconducting coils** → Magnetic containment backbone (12 Tesla, Nb₃Sn)
1. **20 ICRH neutron source modules** → Localized D-T plasma ignition
1. **Tritium breeding blanket** → Neutron multiplication and fuel production

**System Integration Note:** The 12 vertex coils form the high-field superconducting backbone. The 122 RF coils from the full CSG design position on this icosahedral geometry for plasma heating and current drive.

## Three-Phase Startup Protocol

### Phase 1: Magnetic Containment Commissioning (0-15 min)

- **Regulatory Advantage:** Can be tested independently of nuclear operation
- **Sequential Activation:** Vertex pairs → Pentagon rings → Complete icosahedron
- **Power Factor Control:** Phase-locked loops prevent resonance, MPC optimizes ramp rates
- **Power Requirement:** Peak 10 MW → 60 MW cumulative

### Phase 2: Neutron Source Activation (15-45 min)

- **Technology:** Compact ICRH-driven D-T plasma regions in common magnetic field
- **Sequence:** Opposite face pairs for geometric balance (North/South → hemisphere rings)
- **Power Requirement:** 50 MW ignition per module → 500 MW sustained
- **Verification:** >10¹⁶ reactions/second per module before blanket activation

### Phase 3: Tritium Breeding Integration (45-60 min)

- **Blanket Heating:** Li₂TiO₃ breeder material to operating temperature
- **Coolant Circulation:** PbLi loop startup to design flow rates
- **Breeding Verification:** TBR >1.05, neutron flux >10¹⁴ n/cm²/s

## Marine Platform Integration

### Power Factor Solution

**Dual-Function Synchronous Motor:**

- **Primary:** Ship propulsion (variable speed, 0-25 knots)
- **Secondary:** Reactive power correction (35 MVAR capability)
- **Control Strategy:** Speed/excitation varies with reactor VAR needs

### Emergency Independence

**Without VAR Correction:** >1000 MW emergency diesel required  
**With Integrated System:** 25 MW diesel sufficient for complete restart

### Fault Tolerance

- **Lost Vertex Coil:** Automatic field redistribution to adjacent vertices
- **Lost VAR Support:** Synchronous motor compensates, prioritizes restart over propulsion
- **Partial Quench:** Graceful degradation, natural helium cooling recovery
- **Worst Case (Preliminary):** Survives loss of any 2 vertices + 3 neutron modules
